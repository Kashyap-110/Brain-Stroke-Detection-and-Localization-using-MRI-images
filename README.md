# Brain-Stroke-Detection-and-Localization-using-MRI-images
This project predicts and localizes brain strokes from MRI images using deep learning. Detection models (YOLOv5, YOLOv8, YOLOv9, Faster R-CNN) are trained on multiple datasets. Achieved high accuracy with bounding box localization of stroke areas.
